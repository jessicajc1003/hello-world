# Marvel's Spider-man Game Website
As a big fan of the Marvel's Spider-man Game, I re-designed and developed (for the first time!) the original website more dynamic and creative like the comics in 3 weeks. Note that this is for a school project only and all images (including logo) and content are from the game.
