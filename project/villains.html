                    <p>Mister Negative is a man divided. To the citizens of New York City he is Martin Li, respected businessman, philanthropist, and founder of the acclaimed F.E.A.S.T. shelters. But to the underworld he is known as Mister Negative, an upstart crime boss in command of the fearsome Inner Demons and wielder of a dark energy that he uses to destroy anything or anyone standing in his way. Obsessed with exacting revenge against a high-ranking New York City official whom he believes is responsible for his corruptive abilities, Mister Negative is a driving force behind a violent master plan that may rot the Big Apple to its core.</p>
